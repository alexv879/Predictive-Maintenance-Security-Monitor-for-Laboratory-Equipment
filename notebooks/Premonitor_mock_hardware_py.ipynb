        "#What Replaces the Mock Hardware?\n",
        "#You asked an excellent question about what you'll use when you have the real hardware. Once you've purchased the sensors, you will create a new file, let's call it hardware_drivers.py, that will have the exact same function names as this mock file (read_thermal_image, read_acoustic_spectrogram, etc.).\n",
        "#This new file will use specific Python libraries to talk to the real hardware:\n",
        "#To replace read_thermal_image(): You will use a library specific to your thermal camera. For example, if you buy a FLIR Lepton camera with a PureThermal board, you might use the pylepton library to capture a real thermal image array from the camera's USB port.\n",
        "#To replace read_acoustic_spectrogram(): You will use a library like pyaudio or sounddevice to capture a few seconds of audio from the real USB microphone. Your function will then pass this audio chunk to the utils.audio_to_spectrogram() function you've already written.\n",
        "#To replace read_gas_sensor(): You will use the RPi.GPIO library or Adafruit-Blinka with a library for an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) chip like the MCP3008. This will allow you to read the analog voltage from the real MQ gas sensor connected to the Pi's GPIO pins.\n",
        "#The beauty of this approach is that when you're ready to switch to real hardware, you will only need to change one line in your main.py file: from import mock_hardware as hardware to import hardware_drivers as hardware. The rest of your application will work exactly the same.\n",
